 ***Creating the logo as SplashActivity.kt file:
 <br/>
 This helps provide a smoother user experience and gives the application time to initialize resources or perform any necessary setup tasks before presenting the main interface to the user.
 This code defines a `SplashActivity`, which serves as a splash screen for the application. Here's an overview:<br/>
 
 - **Inheritance**: The `SplashActivity` class inherits from `AppCompatActivity`, which is the base class for activities that use the support library action bar features.
 <br/>
 - **Properties**:<br/>
   - `SPLASH_DELAY`: This constant represents the delay time for displaying the splash screen in milliseconds.
 <br/>
 - **Methods**:<br/>
   - `onCreate()`: This method is called when the activity is starting. In this method:
     - The layout for the splash screen is set using `setContentView()`, which inflates the layout defined in the `activity_splash.xml` file.
     - A `Handler` is used to post a delayed action that starts the main activity after the specified `SPLASH_DELAY`. Inside the delayed action, an `Intent` is created to start the `MainActivity`, and the current activity (`SplashActivity`) is finished.
 <br/>
 - **Purpose**: The `SplashActivity` provides a visual transition or loading screen when the application starts. It typically displays a logo or branding for a short period before transitioning to the main activity. 
 <br/>
 ********create the activity_splash.xml file
 <br/>
 Overall, this layout file defines a simple splash screen with a centered image view displaying an image named `bring_to_mind`. The background color of the layout is set to black.

 It abstracts away the complexity of database operations and provides a clean API for performing CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on task items.
 
 This code defines a Data Access Object (DAO) interface named `TaskItemDao`, which specifies the database operations that can be performed on the `TaskItem` entity. Here's an overview:
 <br/>
 - **Annotation**: The `@Dao` annotation indicates that this interface is a Room DAO, which allows Room to generate necessary implementation code at compile time.
 <br/>
 - **Functions**:
   - `allTaskItems()`: This function retrieves all task items from the database and returns them as a Flow of lists of `TaskItem` objects. The use of `Flow` enables observation of data changes in real-time.
   - `insertTaskItem(taskItem: TaskItem)`: Inserts a new task item into the database. The `suspend` keyword indicates that this function can be suspended and executed asynchronously.
   - `updateTaskItem(taskItem: TaskItem)`: Updates an existing task item in the database with the provided `taskItem` object.
   - `deleteTaskItem(taskItem: TaskItem)`: Deletes a specified task item from the database.
   <br/>
 - **Annotations**:
   - `@Query`: Used to execute a SQL query to retrieve data from the database. In this case, it selects all task items from the `task_item_table` and orders them by ID in ascending order.
   - `@Insert`: Specifies an insert operation with `OnConflictStrategy.REPLACE`, which means that if a conflict occurs (i.e., if the inserted item already exists in the database), it will be replaced.
   - `@Update`: Indicates an update operation.
   - `@Delete`: Indicates a delete operation.
   <br/>
 ********create the TaskItemDataBase.kt file

 <br/>
 - **Abstract Functions**:
   - `taskItemDao()`: This abstract function declares a method to obtain the DAO interface for interacting with the `TaskItem` entity.
   <br/>
 - **Companion Object**:
   - `INSTANCE`: This is a volatile variable that holds the reference to the database instance. It's marked as volatile to ensure that its value is always up-to-date across all threads.
   - `getDatabase(context: Context)`: This companion function provides a convenient way to obtain an instance of the `TaskItemDatabase`.
  It follows the singleton pattern to ensure that only one instance of the database is created throughout the application's lifecycle. 
 If an instance already exists, it returns it; otherwise, it creates a new instance using Room's `databaseBuilder` method.
 <br/>
 
 **********create the ToDoAppication.kt file
 <br/>
  By defining these properties in the application class, they can be accessed globally throughout the application's lifecycle. 
 This approach ensures that there's only one instance of the database and repository, promoting efficiency and consistency in data management.
 
 This code defines a custom `Application` class named `TodoApplication`. Here's an overview:
 <br/>
 - **Inheritance**: The class inherits from `Application`, which is the base class for maintaining global application state.
 <br/>
 - **Properties**:
   - `database`: This property is initialized lazily using the `by lazy` delegate. It represents an instance of the `TaskItemDatabase` class obtained by calling the `getDatabase` function, passing the application context (`this`) as a parameter.
   - `repository`: This property is also initialized lazily using the `by lazy` delegate. It represents an instance of the `TaskItemRepository` class, which is constructed by passing the DAO interface obtained from the `database` property.
   <br/>
 - **Purpose**: The `TodoApplication` class serves as the entry point for initializing the Room database and repository in the application.
 <br/>
